DriverTest2

This is code from a tutorial by http://swinbrain.ict.swin.edu.au/wiki/Getting_started_with_SQLite_and_JDBC

I'm practicing connecting my program to a SQLite database and learning the basic components of the code. The first draft of the code is pretty proceedural, I plan to refactor it a bit so it can be a basic template for database connection in a larger project.

The db included is dummy data to accompany the program.
